# News article section prediction using different Deep Learning and Machine Learning model

### Executive Summary:
With the increasing amount of digital content and the expansion of the news industry, it has become challenging to keep track of the different sections of a news article. News articles usually have multiple sections, such as sports, politics, finance, entertainment, and technology. Identifying these sections automatically can be useful for news aggregators, recommendation systems, and other applications. This project aims to analyze and predict the section name of new articles using various deep learning and machine learning models like  LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, Glove+LSTM, CNN, and SVM.
